        long waited, we finally release our debut single, we are so excited about it, and
        I personally feel unbelievable with the sound/production result, I felt its very
        balance between the instrument and everything almost hear clearly. And also Al
        Bino (vocal) and Kusumo (bass) did their job very well, please wait for our next
        release (it could be an EP) to get know more about our sounds and our ability. All
